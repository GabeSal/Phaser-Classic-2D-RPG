# Phaser-Classic-2D-RPG
Using the Phaser CE framework to develop a classic RPG.

# Stuff I've Used
- Phaser 2.10 CE
- Firebase for handling the data and user authentication
- Phaser exercise assets for most of the sprites and images
- Audacity and Adobe Audition for the sound effects (coming in a future commit)
- FL Studio and Kontakt 5 for the music (coming in a future commit)

Currently the app is not allowing any sign-ups to play the game. I will fix this in another commit in the future.
